== Cross-cutting Concepts

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* models, especially domain models
* architecture or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (= cross-cutting) nature
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 
Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks, e.g. security or safety. 

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== Domain Model

A first version of the domain model of the application, representing all the entities that interact with the application and their relations, is shown in the following diagram:

[cols="2,5",options="header"]
|===
| Entity | Description
| **UserClient** | Represents a player, a stakeholder that will make use of the application.
| **API Gateway** | Represents the Gateway that interacts with the microservices that implementation the application functionality.
| **Auth Service** | Represents the Authentication service that will handle the log in of the user.
| **Question Service** | Represents the Question service that will generate the questions that the user will answered during the game.
| **Game Service** | Represents the Game Service that will store the information of the game once it has finished.
| **LLM Service** | Represents the AI chat that will provide hints to the user. 
| **User Service** | Represents the User Service that will add the user information to the database. 
|===

=== Design Patterns and Architectural Styles

The application will be developed following a microservices Architecture. It will have the following microservices:

- Auth Service: It will manage the user login and the creation of the user token.
- User Service: It will add the user to the database.
- Question Service: It will manage the generation of questions of different topics that the user will answer.
- Game Service: It will store the game information on the database once the game has finished.
- LLM Service: It will manage the interaction with the AI and it will generate the hints for the user.
- Gateway Service: It will communicate with the rest of microservices to send the information to the frontend.

=== Persistence Layer

The application will rely its data persistence dependencies on a MongoDB database that will manage the data of the application related to the game sessions (questions, answers, game configurations) or related to the user (user session, user statistics...).

In the future we will change the MongoDB that stores the users to a sqlite database, because with a relational database the user scheme will be more well defined.

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time. This flexibility will help to manage the data of the application, as the structure of the data may change over time as the application evolves. It is not a definite decission, but it is a good starting point to consider.


=== Ensuring a wealthy user experience

==== User Interface

The development team regarding the final application has make it specially atractive to the final user, with a clean and intuitive design that will make the user experience as pleasant as possible. They have developed the application using a responsive design, so it can be used in different devices, like smartphones, tablets, or desktop computers, enhancing usability, accesibility and adaptability at the maximum possible level. For this reason, the internazionalization of the application was a key point to consider, as the application is intended to be used by any kind of users of a wide variety of ages and genders and from different countries and cultures. Right now the application is available in English and Spanish.

==== Session handling and Security

The application has incorporate a basic session handling mechanism to manage the user sessions and to provide a secure environment for the users. The session handling mechanism is be based on the use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate the users and to manage the user sessions.

==== Error handling

The application includes a robust error handling mechanism to manage the errors that may occur during the execution of the application. The error handling mechanism is be based on the use of custom error messages and error codes to provide meaningful information to the users and to help the developers to identify and fix the errors. Error messages are be logged to help the developers to identify and fix the errors. It is important to have a clear and consistent error handling mechanism to ensure that the application is reliable and user-friendly, and that the user does receive only the feedback that is expected to receive (no technical message is displayed to the final user).

==== Logging

The application will have a logging system to monitor the activity of the application and to help the developers to identify and fix the errors that may occur during the execution of the application. The logging system will be based on the use of log files to store the log messages and to provide a history of the activity of the application. The log messages will be stored in a structured format to help the developers to analyze the log messages and to identify the root cause of the errors.

==== Testing

The application is  tested using a combination of unit tests, end-to-end tests, load test and usability tests. 

- **Unit tests** are used to test individual components of the application, mainly based on testing backend functionality to ensure that the internal part of the applications works as expected. Since the application is Dockerized in containers, unit tests can be executed within a container or in a separate testing container that has access to the application's code and dependencies, ensuring that the tests run in an environment identical to production.

- **End-to-end tests** are used to test the application as a whole, simulating the user interaction with the application. They are be performed using containers running the full application stack. This helps to ensure that the application works as expected from the user's perspective.

- **Load tests** are used to test the performance of the application using Gattling.

- **Usability tests** are used to test with real users that the application works as expected. 

=== Deployment

The application is deployed using Docker containers. Docker is a platform that allows developers to develop, ship, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable packages of software that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings. This ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments and that the deployment process remains smooth.

To enable secure HTTPS connections, a reverse proxy such as Nginx is used. Nginx handles SSL termination and routes incoming HTTPS traffic to the appropriate Docker containers. This setup ensures secure communication between clients and the application and simplifies the management of certificates and routing.
