== Architecture Decisions

=== Main webapp technology

Date Recorded: 10/02/2025

Scope: frontend, webapp

Description: The frontend team has opted for a modern framework that offers a combination of performance,
flexibility, and developer experience. One of the team members has prior experience with this technology,
making it a viable choice for building an intuitive user interface.

Decision taken: The team has decided
to use React or a React framework due to the lack of expertise in maintaining a custom stylesheet.

=== Main backend technology
Date Recorded: 10/02/2025

Scope: backend, API

Description: The backend team is currently evaluating whether to use a monolithic Spring Boot-based
approach or maintain a Node.js microservices system. One of the main reasons for considering Spring
Boot is the team's lack of experience with Node.js. Additionally, last yearâ€™s project was implemented using Spring Boot,
which could facilitate development. If needed, Spring Boot provides flexibility for a future migration to microservices.

Decision taken: [TO_BE_TAKEN]

=== Use of MongoDB

Date Recorded: 10/02/2025

Scope: database

Description: Unlike the previous year, where MongoDB was replaced by PostgreSQL,
this year the team has decided to use MongoDB as the primary database system.
The decision aligns with the need to store unstructured question-based data
efficiently and leverage NoSQL advantages for scalability and flexibility.

Decision taken: The team has agreed to use MongoDB as the database for this project.

=== Architecture of the question generator process

Date Recorded: 17/02/2025

Scope: backend, question generator

Description: The question generator is a key component of the system that runs continuously.
It is executed at background periodically to generate new questions. The life of the question generation is the same as the application one, as it is running concurrently.
The question service is divided in question-storage to retrieve
the queries from the database, question-generator who has the logic to generate questions and the question-worker which is the application running concurrently that actually
generates questions.

Decision taken: The team has decided to implement the question generator as a separate concurrent application.

=== Connection to the database with the question generator

Date Recorded: 17/02/2025

Scope: backend, question generator, database

Description: When the questions are generated at background by the question-worker they are stored in the database "questiondb".
Then when someone is playing one of ours games, the questions are retrieved from the database. Furthermore,
the questions have a specific life duration, this means, that when the time specified from its creation passes, the question are eliminated
from the database, the purpose of this is to avoid players to get repeated questions continuously

Decision taken: The team has decided to specify a life duration for the questions


=== Integration of an LLM for hints

Date Recorded: 10/02/2025

Scope: backend, AI integration

Description: The game will integrate an AI model to provide hints to players.
The chosen model must be capable of interpreting image-based questions and
generating meaningful hints.

Decision taken: The team has decided to integrate
the Empathy AI model for generating hints in the game.

.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. 
Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* ADR (https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions[Documenting Architecture Decisions]) for every important decision
* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision

.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-9/[Architecture Decisions] in the arc42 documentation.
There you will find links and examples about ADR.
