.Content
The deployment view describes:

 1. technical infrastructure used to execute your system, with infrastructure elements like geographical locations, environments, computers, processors, channels and net topologies as well as other infrastructure elements and

2. mapping of (software) building blocks to that infrastructure elements.

Often systems are executed in different environments, e.g. development environment, test environment, production environment. In such cases you should document all relevant environments.

Especially document a deployment view if your software is executed as distributed system with more than one computer, processor, server or container or when you design and construct your own hardware processors and chips.

From a software perspective it is sufficient to capture only those elements of an infrastructure that are needed to show a deployment of your building blocks. Hardware architects can go beyond that and describe an infrastructure to any level of detail they need to capture.

.Motivation
Software does not run without hardware.
This underlying infrastructure can and will influence a system and/or some
cross-cutting concepts. Therefore, there is a need to know the infrastructure.

.Form

Maybe a highest level deployment diagram is already contained in section 3.2. as
technical context with your own infrastructure as ONE black box. In this section one can
zoom into this black box using additional deployment diagrams:

* UML offers deployment diagrams to express that view. Use it, probably with nested diagrams,
when your infrastructure is more complex.
* When your (hardware) stakeholders prefer other kinds of diagrams rather than a deployment diagram, let them use any kind that is able to show nodes and channels of the infrastructure.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-7/[Deployment View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Infrastructure Level 1

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Describe (usually in a combination of diagrams, tables, and text):

* distribution of a system to multiple locations, environments, computers, processors, .., as well as physical connections between them
* important justifications or motivations for this deployment structure
* quality and/or performance features of this infrastructure
* mapping of software artifacts to elements of this infrastructure

For multiple environments or alternative deployments please copy and adapt this section of arc42 for all relevant environments.

Motivation::

The above diagram illustrates the high-level deployment architecture of the WIChat application. All components, including the web client (UI) and backend services, are containerized using Docker and deployed on a cloud-based Ubuntu VM (Azure). Although the web client executes in the user's web browser, it is served as a container from the application server. When a user connects, the browser downloads and runs the web application, eliminating the need for a distinct "Client Node."

Quality and/or Performance Features::

The main advantages of this architecture are:
- **Modularity**: All components are deployed as independent containers that can be updated and scaled separately.
- **Interchangeability**: By the same reason as why it is modular, as long as the common API is mantained, the separation of the architecture will allow the replacement and upgrade of implementations without affecting the rest of the system.
- **Portability**: Since Docker containers are platform-agnostic, the application can be easily deployed across different environments (e.g., local development, cloud production) without modification.
- **Scalability**: Having a Gateway Service ensures the system can handle increased traffic by distributing requests across multiple backend instances, enabling horizontal scaling, and integrating with cloud auto-scaling tools.

Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure::
[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Building Block | Infrastructure Component
| **Client / Frontend** | Contained in the `webapp` subfolder. Docker container hosted on Azure. Serves the user interface and communicates with the backend via the gateway service.
| **APIs / Backend** | Docker container hosted on Azure. Handles game logic, user management and question generation. Communicates with the MongoDB database.
| **Gateway Service** | Contained in the `gatewayservice` subfolder. Docker container hosted on a cloud platform. Acts as a single entry point for all incoming requests, routing them to the appropriate services.
| **LLM Service** | Contained in the `llmservice` subfolder. Configuration and API for the external service hosted by the LLM provider. Accessed via HTTPS from the backend to generate conversational hints.
| **Question Generator** | A separate component that runs at the beginning of the application. Queries Wikidata using MQL to generate questions and answers, which are then stored in the MongoDB database.
| **MongoDB Database** | Containerized instance.

=== Infrastructure Level 2

Here you can include the internal structure of (some) infrastructure elements from level 1.

Please copy the structure from level 1 for each selected element.

==== Client / Frontend
The **frontend** is a single-page application (SPA) that runs in the user's web browser. It is built using React and communicates with the backend via the API. The frontend is containerized using Docker and deployed on a cloud platform together with the rest of the components of the application. Static assets (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript) are served via a CDN to reduce latency and improve load times.

==== APIs / Backend
The **backend** is a set of RESTful APIs that provide game logic, user management, and question generation services. It is built using Node.js and Express, and communicates with the MongoDB database. The backend is containerized using Docker and deployed on a cloud platform. The backend is stateless and horizontally scalable, allowing it to handle increased traffic by spinning up additional instances.

=== Conclusion

The Deployment View provides a detailed overview of how the WiChat application will be deployed across different environments and infrastructure components. It ensures that the system meets the quality goal of scalability while supporting efficient development and deployment processes.
