== Building Block View

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations, data structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image::05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-5/[Building Block View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Whitebox Overall System



ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

* an overview diagram
* a motivation for the decomposition
* black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


* (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

**Motivation:**
The purpose of this section is to provide a high-level view of the system and its primary components. This diagram focuses on how the different elements of the system interact and how the player, application, external services like the WikiData API, and the LLM AI Chat function together to support the game.

**Contained Building Blocks:**

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| Player | The player interacts with the system, answering questions and obtaining hints through the interface.
| WIChat Application | The central application that facilitates player interaction, communication with external services, and question generation.
| LLM AI API | Provides hints to the player when requested.
| WikiData API | Supplies data and information used to generate questions about images and concepts.

|===

**Important Interfaces:**

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Interface** | **Purpose**
| Player-Application Interface | Defines the interaction between the player and the application, including how questions are presented and how the player submits answers.
| Application-LLM Interface | Manages communication between the application and the LLM AI API to request hints.
| Application-WikiData Interface | Manages the interaction between the application and the WikiData API to retrieve information for generating questions.

|===

==== Player

* Purpose/Responsibility: The player interacts with the game by answering questions about images and concepts. The player can request hints when needed.
* Interface(s):
- Interaction with the WIChat Application through a user interface (UI) that displays questions and accepts answers.
- Interaction with the LLM AI Chat for hints when requested.
* (Optional) Quality-/Performance Characteristics: Smooth, responsive UI with minimal delays.
* (Optional) Directory/File Location: src/client
* (Optional) Fulfilled Requirements: Real-time gameplay experience with clear and engaging UI.
* (Optional) Open Issues/Problems/Risks: The player should not have access to some internal parts of the application, neither should know how the application is coded.

==== WIChat Application

* Purpose/Responsibility: The main system that handles the gameplay, image-based question generation, interaction with external services (WikiData API, LLM AI Chat), and player progression.
* Interface(s):
- Communication with the Player through the user interface.
- Interaction with the WikiData API to retrieve information and generate questions.
- Communication with the LLM AI Chat to provide hints to the player.
* (Optional) Quality-/Performance Characteristics:
- Scalable, with efficient routing of requests to the relevant components.
* (Optional) Directory/File Location: src/application
* (Optional) Fulfilled Requirements: Real-time interaction and data handling.
* (Optional) Open Issues/Problems/Risks: Performance under high traffic (large number of players simultaneously).

==== LLM AI API

* Purpose/Responsibility: External service that provides AI-generated hints to players based on their interactions within the game.
* Interface(s):
- Receives requests from the WIChat Application to provide hints based on player progress.
* (Optional) Quality-/Performance Characteristics:
- Fast response time and contextually relevant hints.
* (Optional) Directory/File Location: External to the system.
* (Optional) Fulfilled Requirements: High-quality hint generation.
* (Optional) Open Issues/Problems/Risks: Dependency on external AI service reliability. Since this component consists on an AI-based chat, it is important to maintain the integrity of its responses, limiting the queries that the users may perform so that the goal of the LLM doesn't get blurred and it doesn't get influenced by any behaviour that the user tries to introduce. It should only work as a clue generator, and ensuring that this behaviour persists must be a primary focus.

==== WikiData API

* Purpose/Responsibility: External service that provides detailed information about images and concepts for generating game-related questions.
* Interface(s):
- Receives requests from the WIChat Application to retrieve image-related data.
* (Optional) Quality-/Performance Characteristics:
- Relevant, accurate, and up-to-date information.
* (Optional) Directory/File Location: External to the system.
* (Optional) Fulfilled Requirements: Sufficient data to generate accurate and diverse questions.
* (Optional) Open Issues/Problems/Risks: Limited data availability and consistency in the API's responses.

=== Container Diagram (C4 Level 2)

**Motivation:**
The system decomposition has been done to efficiently divide responsibilities, ensure scalability, and facilitate understanding of the system in terms of components and their interactions. The system is broken down into key blocks that interact with each other and with external systems, such as the LLM and the WikiData API.
