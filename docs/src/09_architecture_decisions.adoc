== Architecture Decisions

=== Main webapp technology

Date Recorded: 10/02/2025

Scope: frontend, webapp

Description: The frontend team has opted for a modern framework that offers a combination of performance,
flexibility, and developer experience. One of the team members has prior experience with this technology,
making it a viable choice for building an intuitive user interface.

Decision taken: The team has decided
to use React or a React framework due to the lack of expertise in maintaining a custom stylesheet.

=== Main backend technology
Date Recorded: 10/02/2025

Scope: backend, API

Description: The backend team is currently evaluating whether to use a monolithic Spring Boot-based
approach or maintain a Node.js microservices system. One of the main reasons for considering Spring
Boot is the team's lack of experience with Node.js. Additionally, last yearâ€™s project was implemented using Spring Boot,
which could facilitate development. If needed, Spring Boot provides flexibility for a future migration to microservices.

Decision taken: The team has decide to use Node.js microservices system.

=== Use of MongoDB

Date Recorded: 10/02/2025

Scope: database

Description: Unlike the previous year, where MongoDB was replaced by PostgreSQL,
this year the team has decided to use MongoDB as the primary database system.
The decision aligns with the need to store unstructured question-based data
efficiently and leverage NoSQL advantages for scalability and flexibility.

Decision taken: The team has agreed to use MongoDB as the database for this project.

=== Architecture of the question generator process

Date Recorded: 17/02/2025

Scope: backend, question generator

Description: The question generator is a key component of the system but does not need to run continuously.
It will be executed when new questions need to be loaded or updated. To maintain a clean architecture, it
should be implemented as a separate module rather than part of the API.

Decision taken: The team has decided to implement the question generator as a separate module of the application.

=== Connection to the database with the question generator

Date Recorded: 17/02/2025

Scope: backend, question generator, database

Description: When the questions are generated at background by the question-worker they are stored in the database "questiondb".
Then when someone is playing one of ours games, the questions are retrieved from the database. Furthermore,
the questions have a specific life duration, this means, that when the time specified from its creation passes, the question are eliminated
from the database, the purpose of this is to avoid players to get repeated questions continuously

Decision taken: The team has decided to specify a life duration for the questions


=== Integration of an LLM for hints

Date Recorded: 10/02/2025

Scope: backend, AI integration

Description: The game will integrate an AI model to provide hints to players.
The chosen model must be capable of interpreting image-based questions and
generating meaningful hints.

Decision taken: The team has decided to integrate the Empathy AI model for generating hints in the game.

=== Game modes

Date Recorded: 3/03/2025

Scope: backend, frontend

Description: Discusion on wich game modes the application will have.

Decision taken: The team has decided to implement: normal game mode, expert domain, time attack and endless marathon.

=== Creating Game Service

Date Recorded: 14/03/2025

Scope: backend

Description: Discusion on where to implement the game functionallity.

Decision taken: The gameservice will be a new module in the future, the one who will be in charge of tracking scores of players in different gamemodes.

=== Generate questions 

Date Recorded: 14/03/2025

Scope: backend

Description: Discusion how many questions the backend will retrieved.

Decision taken: Decided that to ease the system's performance, the questions will be retrieved by id in batches of 5.

=== Generate questions 

Date Recorded: 28/03/2025

Scope: frontend

Description: Discusion of the route strategy of the frontend and error page.

Decision taken: Decided to create an Error page that by default is the endpoint where the user gets redirected if he/she tries to access a site in the application that is not available and  decided to keep the route strategy that we held at first, treating all the different game modes as one in terms of routing.

=== Use of JWT tokens

Date Recorded: 4/04/2025

Scope: backend, game service, auth service

Description: When the user logs into the application a token will be generated. We will use this token to make sure that the user is log in when we save a score after a game or when we access the user statistics.

Decision taken: The team has decided to integrate the JWT token functionallity to the game service.


=== Implementation of https

Date Recorded: 4/04/2025

Scope: backend, gateway service

Description: The application will have https. It will be implemnted using NGINX that acts as a reverse proxy and is used primarily to eneable HTTPS.

Decision taken: The team has decided to implement the functionallity

=== Score when using hints

Date Recorded: 28/04/2025

Scope: backend, frontend

Description: Discuss if we should penalize the user when he/she uses the hints provided by the ai.

Decision taken: Decide not to penalize if asking to the ia via chat as using the time left for calculating the score already penalizes the user stalling.

.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. 
Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* ADR (https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions[Documenting Architecture Decisions]) for every important decision
* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision

.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-9/[Architecture Decisions] in the arc42 documentation.
There you will find links and examples about ADR.
